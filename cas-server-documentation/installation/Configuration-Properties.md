# CAS Properties

Various properties can be specified inside CAS either inside configuration files or as command 
line switches. This section provides a list common CAS properties and 
references to the underlying modules that consume them.

This section is meant as a guide only. Do not copy/paste the entire content into your CAS configuration; 
rather pick only the properties that you need.
