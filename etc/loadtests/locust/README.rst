These script files were created as a starting point for users to test the various protocols supported by CAS with the Python Locust load testing framework.  Feel free to use and update to meet your needs.

The Python version used to create these script = Python 3.7.5

There are 4 example scripts available for your use.

- old_locustfile.py - This file is the old locust script file used for CAS v5 testing.  This still can be used and is included as a comparison file to the other 3.  Created with Locust 0.8a2
- casLocust.py - A newer version of the old_locustfile.py.  Uses and updated Locus version of 0.13.2
- samlLocust.py - Script file for testing SAML protocol.
- bothLocust.py - Script file combining the CAS and SAML protocol files to test against a CAS instance.

To run these scripts enter the following at the root of the locust project:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ locust -f cas5/locustfile.py --host=https://cas.stage.lafayette.edu
