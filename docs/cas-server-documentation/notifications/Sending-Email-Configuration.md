# Sending Email

CAS presents the ability to notify users on select actions via email messages. Example actions include notification 
of risky authentication attempts or password reset links/tokens, etc. Configuring 
an email provider (i.e. Amazon Simple Email Service )
is a matter of defining SMTP settings. Each particular feature 
in need of email functionality should be able to 
gracefully continue in case settings are not defined. 

Default support for email notifications is automatically 
enabled/included by the relevant modules using the following module:

{% include casmodule.html group="org.apereo.cas" module="cas-server-core-notifications" %}

You need not explicitly include this module in WAR Overlay configurations, except 
when there is a need to access components and APIs at compile-time. 

{% include {{ version }}/email-notifications-configuration.md configKey="<configuration-key>" %}
