# RC1 Release Notes

We strongly recommend that you take advantage of the release candidates as they come out. Waiting 
for a `GA` release is only going to set you up for unpleasant surprises. A `GA` 
is simply [a tag and nothing more](https://apereo.github.io/2017/03/08/the-myth-of-ga-rel/). Note that CAS 
releases are *strictly* time-based releases; they are not scheduled or based on 
specific benchmarks, statistics or completion of features. To gain confidence in 
a particular release, it is strongly recommended that you start early by 
experimenting with release candidates and/or follow-up snapshots.

## Apereo Membership

If you benefit from Apereo CAS as free and open-source software, we 
invite you to [join the Apereo Foundation](https://www.apereo.org/content/apereo-membership) 
and financially support the project at a capacity that best suits your 
deployment. Note that all development activity is performed 
*almost exclusively* on a voluntary basis with no expectations, commitments or strings 
attached. Having the financial means to better sustain engineering activities will allow 
the developer community to allocate *dedicated and committed* time for long-term 
support, maintenance and release planning, especially when it comes to addressing 
critical and security issues in a timely manner. Funding will ensure support for 
the software you rely on and you gain an advantage and say in the way Apereo, and 
the CAS project at that, runs and operates. If you consider your CAS deployment to 
be a critical part of the identity and access management ecosystem, this is a viable option to consider.

## Get Involved

- Start your CAS deployment today. Try out features and [share feedback](/cas/Mailing-Lists.html).
- Better yet, [contribute patches](/cas/developer/Contributor-Guidelines.html).
- Suggest and apply documentation improvements.

## New & Noteworthy

The following items are new improvements and enhancements presented in this release.
               
### Spring Boot 2.4
                  
CAS is now based on the Spring Boot `2.4.x` series which by extension also requires CAS to upgrade
its dependency on related projects such as [Spring and Spring Cloud](../planning/Architecture.html). While this is a 
significant framework upgrade, the change should remain largely invisible to CAS users and adopters.

### Testing Strategy

Th collection of [end-to-end browser tests](../developer/Test-Process.html) based on Puppeteer 
continue to grow to add additional scenarios and use cases, such as recaptcha, logout, and more.
Furthermore, the CAS codebase is now running its entire tests suite against Ubuntu, Windows and MacOS
platforms. New test categories are also added to account for SAML2 integration tests both as an
identity provider and service provider, along with tests specific OpenID Connect authentication
flows for `code`, `token`, `id_token` and more.
  
### Logout Confirmations

Upon [logout confirmations](../installation/Logout-Single-Signout.html), the 
CAS user interface and confirmation screens are 
now able to list all applications linked to the existing SSO session.

### XML-less Spring Webflow

The construction of various [Spring Webflow flows](../webflow/Webflow-Customization.html) and (multifactor authentication) subflows 
has now removed the requirement for an XML foundation, allowing the construction of all flows to be dynamic.

### WebAuthN REST Device Management

[WebAuthN/FIDO2 Device registrations](../mfa/FIDO2-WebAuthn-Authentication.html) 
may be managed using an external REST API.

### Scriptable LDAP Queries

Search filters used to query LDAP for results can now be designed as Groovy scripts
to provide dynamic querying options.

### Inwebo MFA Integration

Support for [inWebo](../mfa/Inwebo-Authentication.html) as a multifactor authentication provider is now available.
 
### SCIM Provisioning

Integration with [SCIM Provisioning](../integration/SCIM-Integration.html) is slightly
improved to allow SCIM targets and settings per registered application.

### WebAuthN Redis Device Management

[WebAuthN/FIDO2 Device registrations](../mfa/FIDO2-WebAuthn-Authentication.html)
may be managed using a Redis database.

### Grouper Access Strategy

[Grouper Service Access Strategy](../services/Configuring-Service-Access-Strategy.html) can 
now accept configuration properties 
in the service definition to override the default Grouper settings.

### CORS Per Service

[CORS configuration](../services/Configuring-Service-Http-Security-Headers.html) and 
relevant headers, etc can now be defined on a per-application basis.

### SAML2 Metadata via Redis

Metadata artifacts that belong to CAS as a SAML2 identity provider, as well as metadata
for service providers can now be [managed via Redis](../installation/Configuring-SAML2-DynamicMetadata.html).

### ACME & Let's Encrypt

CAS can now enable support for the [(ACME) protocol](../integration/ACME-Integration.html) 
using a certificate authority (CA) such as Let's Encrypt.

### Gradle 6.8

The CAS codebase is now using Gradle version `6.8` for internal builds. All plugins and build deprecation warnings
are adjusted, fixed or removed to make for a smooth transition to version `7` as the next release of the Gradle build tool.

### Multifactor Trusted Devices via Redis 

[Multifactor Trusted Devices](../mfa/Multifactor-TrustedDevice-Authentication.html) and user 
decisions for multifactor authentication may also be kept inside a Redis instance.

## Other Stuff
     
- [Hazelcast cluster configuration](../ticketing/Hazelcast-Ticket-Registry.html) allows specification of network interfaces.
- Delegated authentication configuration can allow for a pre-defined callback/redirect URI.
- Configuration metadata is corrected in a number of cases to make sure `@NestedConfigurationProperty` is properly set on fields.
- Publishing Maven metadata into the local maven repository is corrected to include all CAS-required repositories.
