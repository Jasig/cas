# 7.1.0-RC6 Release Notes

We strongly recommend that you take advantage of the release candidates as they come out. Waiting for a `GA` release is only going to set
you up for unpleasant surprises. A `GA` is [a tag and nothing more](https://apereo.github.io/2017/03/08/the-myth-of-ga-rel/). Note
that CAS releases are *strictly* time-based releases; they are not scheduled or based on specific benchmarks,
statistics or completion of features. To gain confidence in a particular
release, it is strongly recommended that you start early by experimenting with release candidates and/or follow-up snapshots.

## Apereo Membership

If you benefit from Apereo CAS as free and open-source software, we invite you
to [join the Apereo Foundation](https://www.apereo.org/content/apereo-membership)
and financially support the project at a capacity that best suits your deployment. Note that all development activity is performed
*almost exclusively* on a voluntary basis with no expectations, commitments or strings attached. Having the financial means to better
sustain engineering activities will allow the developer community to allocate *dedicated and committed* time for long-term support,
maintenance and release planning, especially when it comes to addressing critical and security issues in a timely manner.

## Get Involved

- Start your CAS deployment today. Try out features and [share feedback](/cas/Mailing-Lists.html).
- Better yet, [contribute patches](/cas/developer/Contributor-Guidelines.html).
- Suggest and apply documentation improvements.

## Resources

- [Release Schedule](https://github.com/apereo/cas/milestones)
- [Release Policy](/cas/developer/Release-Policy.html)

## System Requirements

The JDK baseline requirement for this CAS release is and **MUST** be JDK `21`. All compatible distributions
such as Amazon Corretto, Zulu, Eclipse Temurin, etc should work and are implicitly supported.

## New & Noteworthy

The following items are new improvements and enhancements presented in this release.

### CAS Delegated Authentication

All functionality and components that allow CAS to route authentication requests to external CAS identity providers are now consolidated under a single module.
This is done to simplify the setup in a more modular way and reduce the number of libraries and dependencies that would be pulled into the build.

Please make sure you review the [CAS delegated authentication](../integration/Delegate-Authentication-CAS.html) page and include the correct module in your build.

<div class="alert alert-warning">:warning: <strong>Usage Warning!</strong><p>
This is potentially a breaking change. Make sure to review your build's dependencies and adjust modules to restore functionality.
</p></div>

### Graal VM Native Images

A CAS server installation and deployment process can be tuned to build and run
as a [Graal VM native image](../installation/GraalVM-NativeImage-Installation.html).
The collection of end-to-end [browser tests based on Puppeteer](../../developer/Test-Process.html) have selectively switched
to build and verify Graal VM native images and we plan to extend the coverage to all such scenarios in the coming releases.
 
### Palantir Admin Console

Small efforts are underway to improve the [Palantir Admin Console](../installation/Admin-Dashboard.html) as a viable alternative to the CAS Management tool.
The console is now able to display and manage registered services and show basic information about system status, health, etc. We'll continue to refine
the console and add more features in the coming releases.

### Testing Strategy

The collection of end-to-end [browser tests based via Puppeteer](../../developer/Test-Process.html) continue to grow to cover more use cases
and scenarios. At the moment, total number of jobs stands at approximately `486` distinct scenarios. The overall
test coverage of the CAS codebase is approximately `94%`. Furthermore, a large number of test categories that group internal unit tests
are now configured to run with parallelism enabled.

## Other Stuff

- Many small improvements and bug fixes in CAS documentation to remove typos and correct references.
- When attempting to resolve SAML2 metadata, particularly via URLs, the number of retry attempts is now configurable.
- Small improvements to [Redis Ticket Registry](../ticketing/Redis-Ticket-Registry.html) to prevent memory leaks and crashes.
