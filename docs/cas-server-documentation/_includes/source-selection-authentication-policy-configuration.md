### Source Selection

Allows CAS to select authentication handlers based on the credential source. This allows the authentication engine to restrict the task of validating credentials
to the selected source or account repository, as opposed to every authentication handler.

```properties
# cas.authn.policy.source-selection-enabled=true
```
