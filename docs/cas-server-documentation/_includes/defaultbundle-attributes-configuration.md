If you wish to release a default bundle of attributes to all applications,
and you would rather not duplicate the same attribute per every service definition,
then the following settings are relevant:

```properties
# cas.authn.attribute-repository.default-attributes-to-release=cn,givenName,uid,affiliation
```
