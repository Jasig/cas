# Deny Authentication

Denying authentication allows CAS to reject access to a set of credentials.
Those that fail to match against the predefined set will blindly be accepted.

## Configuration

Support is enabled by including the following dependency in the WAR overlay:

{% include casmodule.html group="org.apereo.cas" module="cas-server-support-generic" %}

{% include {{ version }}/principal-transformation-configuration.md configKey="cas.authn.reject" %}

{% include {{ version }}/password-encoding-configuration.md configKey="cas.authn.reject" %}

{% include {{ version }}/rejectusers-authentication-configuration.md %}
