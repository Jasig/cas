# GraalVM Native Image Installation

[GraalVM Native Images](https://www.graalvm.org/native-image/) are standalone executables that can be generated by 
processing compiled Java applications ahead-of-time. Native Images generally have a smaller memory footprint and start faster than their JVM counterparts.

A CAS server installation and deployment process can be tuned to build and run as a GraalVM native image. Compared to the Java Virtual Machine, CAS server 
native images can run with a smaller memory footprint and with much faster startup times. A CAS GraalVM Native Image is a complete, platform-specific 
executable. You do not need to ship a Java Virtual Machine in order to run a CAS native image. It requires and uses ahead-of-time processing in order to 
create an executable. This ahead-of-time processing involves statically analyzing CAS application code from its main entry point.

This capability is a work in progress, requires a lot of trial and error and is highly experimental at this point.</p></div>

There are some key differences between native and JVM-based CAS deployments. The main differences are:

- Static analysis of the CAS server is performed at build-time from the main entry point.
- Code that cannot be reached when the native image is created will be removed and wonâ€™t be part of the executable.
- GraalVM is not directly aware of dynamic elements in CAS code and must be told about reflection, resources, serialization, and dynamic proxies.
- The CAS server application classpath is fixed at build time and cannot change.
- There is no lazy class loading and everything shipped in the executables will be loaded in memory on startup.
   
## System Requirements

A GraalVM distribution compatible with the overall [CAS requirements](../planning/Installation-Requirements.html) must be present on the build machine.
Presently and at a minimum, you will need to have `GraalVM 22.3.1` installed with 
the [native image tool](https://www.graalvm.org/latest/reference-manual/native-image/) in place.
