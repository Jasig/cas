<div id="googleterms">
<p class="b">Google Terms of Service</p> 
		<p>Welcome to Google! By using Google’s products, software, services or web sites ("Google services"), you agree to the following terms and conditions, and any policies, guidelines or amendments thereto that may be presented to you from time to time, including but not limited to Program Policies and Legal Notices (collectively, the "Terms").  We may update the Terms in the future, and you will be able to find the most current version of this agreement at <a href="http://www.google.com/a/help/intl/en/users/terms.html">http://www.google.com/a/help/intl/en/users/terms.html</a>.</p> 
		 <ol type="1"> 
 
		<li><b>USE OF SERVICES</b> <br> 
			Google Inc., its subsidiaries and affiliated companies, including your <a href="http://www.google.com/support/a/bin/answer.py?answer=178897">domain
			administrator</a>  ("Google") offer
				Google services to you, provided that you are of legal age to form a binding contract and are not a person barred from receiving
				services under the laws of the United States or other applicable jurisdiction.  In order to access certain services, you may be
				required to provide current, accurate identification, contact, and other information as part of the registration process and/or
				continued use of Google services. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account password, and are responsible
				for all activities that occur under your account. You agree to immediately notify Google of any unauthorized use of your password
				or account or any other breach of security. Google cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure
				to provide us with accurate information or to keep your password secure.<br> 
				<br></li> 
		<li><b>APPROPRIATE CONDUCT </b>  <br> 
 
			You understand that all information, data, text, software, music, sound, photographs, graphics, video, messages or other materials
				("Content") are the sole responsibility of the person from which such Content originated.  Google reserves the right, but shall
				have no obligation, to pre-screen, flag, filter, refuse, modify or move any Content available via Google services.  You understand
				that by using Google services you may be exposed to Content that is offensive, indecent or objectionable, and that you use Google
				services at your own risk.  For some services, Google provides tools to filter out adult sexual content, including our SafeSearch
				preference settings (see <a href="http://www.google.com/help/customize.html#safe">http://www.google.com/help/customize.html#safe</a>). 
				In addition, there are commercially available services and software to limit access to material that you may find objectionable. <br> 
				<br> 
			You agree that you are responsible for your own conduct and any Content that you create, transmit or display while using Google services
			and for any consequences thereof. You agree to use Google services only for purposes that are legal, proper and in accordance with
			the Terms and any applicable policies or guidelines.  You agree that you will not engage in any activity that interferes with or disrupts
			Google services or servers or networks connected to Google services.   To report any activity or Content that may violate the Terms,
			please go to <a href="http://www.google.com/support/bin/request.py?hl="><u>http://www.google.com/support/bin/request.py</u></a>. <br> 
			<br> 
			In addition to this agreement, your use of some specific Google services is governed by the policies or guidelines specific to those
			services and which are specifically incorporated into this agreement.<br />   
			<br> 
      
      You agree to comply with your company's data usage and privacy policies.<br /> 
			<br> 
			Users outside of the United States agree to comply with their own local rules regarding online conduct and acceptable content, including
			laws regulating the export of data to and from the United States or your country of residence. <br><br></li> 
		<li><b>GOOGLE PRIVACY POLICY </b> <br> 
			For information about our data protection practices, please see our Privacy Policy at <a href="http://www.google.com/a/help/intl/en/users/privacy.html">http://www.google.com/a/help/intl/en/users/privacy.html</a>. 
			By using Google services, you acknowledge and agree that Google may access, preserve, and disclose your account information and any
			Content associated with that account if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access preservation or disclosure
			is reasonably necessary to: (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce
			the Terms, including investigation of potential violations hereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical
			issues (including, without limitation, the filtering of spam), or (d) protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety
			of Google, its users or the public as required or permitted by law. <br> 
			<br> 
			You understand that the technical processing and transmission of Google services, including your Content, may involve (a) transmissions
			over various networks; and (b) changes to conform and adapt to technical requirements of connecting networks, devices or services. <br> 
 
			<br> 
			You also understand and agree that your <a href="http://www.google.com/support/a/bin/answer.py?answer=178897">domain administrator</a> may
			have access to your account and its content, and may suspend or terminate your account access and your ability to modify your account.<br>

			submitted.  <br><br></li>

				<i>Entire Agreement.</i> The Terms (including any policies, guidelines or amendments that may be presented to your form time to
				time such as Program Policies and Legal Notices) constitute the entire agreement between you and Google and govern your use of
				Google services, superceding any prior agreements between you and Google for the use of Google services. You also may be subject

			<br> 
			<i>Choice of Law and Forum.</i> The Terms and the relationship between you and Google shall be governed by the laws of the State of

			of the courts located within the county of Santa Clara, California. <br> 
 
			<br> 
			<i>Waiver and Severability of Terms.</i> The failure of Google to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms shall not
			constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of the Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid,
			the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision,
			and the other provisions of the Terms remain in full force and effect. <br> 
			<br> 
			<i>Statute of Limitations.</i> You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising
			out of or related to use of Google services or the Terms must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose
			or be forever barred. <br>
