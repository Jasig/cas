/**
 * Concrete implementation of a proxy granting ticket (PGT). A PGT is
 * used by a service to obtain proxy tickets for obtaining access to a back-end
 * service on behalf of a client. It is analogous to a ticket-granting ticket
 * but only for proxying purposes. Proxy tickets will be issued off of
 * a given proxy granting ticket.
 * <p>
 * NOTE: A PGT shares the same implementation as a {@link TicketGrantingTicket}.
 * The intension of this implementation at this point is make explicit and visible
 * the use and declaration of a PGT per the CAS protocol.
