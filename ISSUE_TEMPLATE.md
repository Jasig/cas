## Before you report issues
In order to streamline the process of evaluating issues, we ask that you:

- First, check with CAS' user mailing list to see if the issue has been reported there and if there are any workarounds.
- Cross check with the official CAS documentation to see if there are any missing steps in your configuration.
- Check CAS' issue tracker to see if your issue has already been reported.
 
## Remember that...
If you have a question about how to configure a feature in CAS, please use the CAS mailing lists instead. If your submission is not an actual issue or does not carry enough diagnostic data, the issue may be automatically closed.

## When you report an issue
Ensure that you have reported the following:

1. CAS server version
2. Container type/version (Tomcat, Jetty, etc)
3. Steps to duplicate the problem
4. Stacktraces and CAS logs where appropriate.

## To reproduce the issue

When and where appropriate, please submit your CAS configuration/overlay to this project in form of a pull request so we could easily evaluate your deployment configuration to reproduce the issue:

Thank you.
