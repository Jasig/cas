# Overview

This is where CAS deployers and adopters advertise their deployment to others to 
help promote further opportunities for collaboration and adoption. You are welcome to include as much
information about your deployment as you want to, but at a minimum, it is recommended that each 
entry in the list contain the name of the deploying institution/organization, 
a link and perhaps a contact.

## Add Deployments

This page is maintained as part of the Apereo CAS project's documentation. Changes and new additions are to be submitted 
via [a pull request](developer/Contributor-Guidelines.html)
to the `gh-pages` branch of [the project repository](https://github.com/apereo/cas). 

You may also contact the project members directly with any additions and updates to your listing.

Deployments listed on this page are **NOT** endorsed or kept up to date by the
Apereo CAS project or the Apereo foundation for that matter. Please keep in mind that this is neither a requirement nor a promise 
of extra/special support. This is a page for the project deployers by the project deployers. The project
is also **NOT** held responsibible for use of promotional material on this page, such as 
links, logos, etc. 

Think carefully before listing your deployment.
