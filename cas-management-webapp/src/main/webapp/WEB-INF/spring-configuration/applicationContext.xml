    <!-- Message source for this context, loaded from localized "messages_xx" files.
    	Disable the fallback mechanism to the system/JVM locale. By turning off this behavior, CAS
    	will be able to revert back to the default language bundle that is "messages.properties"
    	and will not rely on the JVM default locale which introduces the side effect of rendering
    	the UI in the JVM locale by default.
